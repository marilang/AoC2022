    "Represent the positions of the head (H) and tail (T) relative to the starting position ([0 0]) as numpy arrays containing x,y coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step in the series of motions will result in a displacement (D) of the head, horizontally or vertically, by one unit in the given direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The displacement of the head will result in tension in the rope. The force (F) of this tension is proportional to the Euclidean distance. To avoid dealing with rounding errors, we'll work with the square of the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If head and tail are adjacent, including diagonally, Fsq <= 2 and the tail doesn't move.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the head moves to a position 2 units horizontally or vertically from the tail, now Fsq > 2 and the tail moves one unit in the direction of the nonzero F component. The tail displacement is thus sign(F).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the head is already diagonally adjacent, and it moves farther from the tail, then the tail will move one unit in each dimension toward the head. The tail displacement in this case is still sign(F).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the tail is in a location we haven't visited yet, store the coordinates as text."
